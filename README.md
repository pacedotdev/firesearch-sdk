# firesearch-sdk

Firesearch SDK, client libraries, and example code.

## Clients

Firesearch clients allow you to interact with your instances
via Firesearch's API.

### No dependency management

A simple way to integrate with Firesearch without dependency management
is to copy the client files directly into your own project.

This is perfect for quickly hacking together an experiment.

* [Download Go client source code](./clients/go/firesearch.gen.go)
* [Download Swift client source code](./clients/swift/Firesearch.gen.swift)

###Â Go 

```bash
go get github.com/pacedotdev/firesearch-sdk/clients/go
```

* The Go client is maintained as a Go module

## Firesearch: Example projects

These little example projects use the Firesearch clients to interact with 
a running Firesearch instance.

You can follow the [Live tutorial](https://firesearch.dev/docs/tutorial) to get an instance
running locally, and then run any of the example projects.

* These examples require the `firesearch-tutorial/indexes/movies-index` index that gets created when you follow the live tutorial inside Firesearch
